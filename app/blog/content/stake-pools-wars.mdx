# raSOL: The Most Community-Centric Liquid Staking Token on Solana

Liquid staking on Solana is booming — with options like Marinade (mSOL), Jito (JitoSOL), SolBlaze (bSOL), and the newcomer raSOL. But what makes raSOL stand out in this crowded space?

## What Is raSOL?

raSOL is a liquid staking token (LST) that represents staked SOL on the Solana blockchain. When you stake SOL through Hubra, you receive raSOL in return, which:

- Earns staking rewards automatically
- Remains liquid and tradable
- Can be used across DeFi protocols
- Grows in value as rewards accrue

## Why Choose raSOL?

### Community-First Approach

Unlike other LSTs, raSOL puts the community at the forefront:

- **Zero Protocol Fees:** 100% of staking rewards go to holders
- **Transparent Validator Selection:** Community-driven validator choices
- **Open Governance:** Community votes on important decisions
- **Fair Distribution:** No insider allocations or pre-mines

### Superior Features

- **Instant Liquidity:** Trade or use raSOL without unstaking delays
- **DeFi Integration:** Use raSOL as collateral across major protocols
- **Auto-Compounding:** Rewards automatically increase your stake
- **Multi-Validator:** Distributed across quality validators for security

### Competitive Advantages

| Feature              | raSOL | mSOL | JitoSOL | bSOL |
| -------------------- | ------ | ---- | ------- | ---- |
| Protocol Fee         | 2.5%     | 2%   | 4%      | 2%   |
| Community Governance | ✅     | ❌   | ❌      | ❌   |
| DeFi Integration     | ✅     | ✅   | ✅      | ✅   |
| Instant Liquidity    | ✅     | ✅   | ✅      | ✅   |

## How It Works

1. **Stake SOL** - Deposit your SOL into the Hubra staking pool
2. **Receive raSOL** - Get raSOL tokens representing your stake + future rewards
3. **Earn Rewards** - Your raSOL grows in value as staking rewards accrue
4. **Use or Trade** - Use raSOL in DeFi or trade it anytime
5. **Unstake** - Convert back to SOL whenever you want

## The Validator Network

raSOL distributes stake across a carefully curated set of validators:

- **High Performance:** Only validators with >99% uptime
- **Decentralization:** Geographic and infrastructure diversity
- **Security:** Rigorous security standards
- **Community Input:** Validator selection influenced by community

## DeFi Opportunities

Use your raSOL across the Solana DeFi ecosystem:

- **Liquidity Pools:** Provide liquidity and earn trading fees
- **Lending Protocols:** Use as collateral to borrow other assets
- **Yield Farming:** Earn additional rewards in DeFi protocols
- **Swap:** Trade for other tokens on DEXes

## Risk Considerations

While raSOL offers many benefits, consider these risks:

- **Smart Contract Risk:** All DeFi carries smart contract risk
- **Validator Risk:** Performance depends on validator quality
- **Market Risk:** raSOL price can fluctuate with SOL and market conditions
- **Depegging Risk:** LSTs can temporarily trade below their intrinsic value

## Community & Governance

## Conclusion
