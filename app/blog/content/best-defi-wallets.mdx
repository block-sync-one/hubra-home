## Which Wallet Should You Choose?

There is no single best wallet - it depends on how you use Solana. New to DeFi? Start with Phantom. Holding serious funds? Add a Ledger. Trading actively on mobile? Jupiter Wallet. Managing a team treasury? Squads.

Most active users end up with multiple wallets for different purposes. If that sounds like you, a unified dashboard like Hubra makes it easy to track everything in one place without switching between apps.
