A DeFi wallet stores your crypto and lets you connect to dApps, swap tokens, stake assets, and use Web3 apps.

But not all wallets are created equal. Some are simple. Some are powerful. Some try to be both.

**Here are the 7 best DeFi wallets in 2026**, and how to choose the right one for you.

---

## What we evaluated

Here&apos;s what we looked at:

- **Security** - How safe are your assets?
- **Chain support** - Which blockchains work?
- **DeFi features** - Built-in swaps, staking, yield?
- **User experience** - Is it easy to use?
- **Self-custody** - Do YOU control the keys?

All wallets below are **non-custodial** - meaning you hold your private keys, not a company.

## The 7 best DeFi wallets

### 1. Hubra - best all-in-one DeFi platform

**Chains:** Solana  
**Type:** Web app + Mobile  
**Best for:** Users who want everything in one place

Hubra isn&apos;t just a wallet - it&apos;s a complete DeFi operating system. Track your portfolio, swap tokens, stake SOL, explore protocols, and earn yield - all from one clean interface.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ CEX-like simplicity with full self-custody
- ✅ Gasless transactions (no SOL needed for fees)
- ✅ Built-in staking with raSOL
- ✅ Portfolio tracking across all Solana assets
- ✅ DeFi protocol explorer

**Drawbacks:**

### 2. Phantom - best Solana wallet

**Chains:** Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, Base, Bitcoin  
**Type:** Browser extension + Mobile  
**Best for:** Solana-native users, NFT collectors

Phantom is the most popular Solana wallet, and for good reason. It&apos;s fast, clean, and supports NFTs beautifully. Multi-chain support has expanded, but Solana remains its strength.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ Best-in-class Solana experience
- ✅ Beautiful NFT display
- ✅ Built-in swap with Jupiter routing
- ✅ Multi-chain expanding

**Drawbacks:**
- Limited DeFi features vs all-in-one platforms
- ETH/EVM support is newer

**Best for:** Solana power users and NFT collectors.

---

### 3. MetaMask - best for Ethereum & EVM

**Chains:** Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, 100+ EVM chains  
**Type:** Browser extension + Mobile  
**Best for:** EVM ecosystem users

MetaMask is the original DeFi wallet. If you&apos;re on Ethereum or any EVM chain, you&apos;ve probably used it. It&apos;s battle-tested, widely supported, and integrates with virtually every dApp.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ Universal EVM support
- ✅ Works with almost every dApp
- ✅ Massive ecosystem
- ✅ Portfolio tracking improving

**Drawbacks:**
- Can feel clunky compared to newer wallets
- Phishing target due to popularity
- No Solana support

**Best for:** Ethereum/EVM DeFi users who need maximum compatibility.

---

### 4. Rabby - best security-focused wallet

**Chains:** Ethereum + EVM chains  
**Type:** Browser extension + Mobile  
**Best for:** Security-conscious users

Rabby is a MetaMask alternative built with security front-and-center. It shows you exactly what a transaction will do before you sign, helping you avoid scams and mistakes.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ Pre-transaction simulation (see what you&apos;re signing)
- ✅ Scam detection warnings
- ✅ Clean, modern UI
- ✅ Multi-wallet support

**Drawbacks:**
- EVM only
- Smaller ecosystem than MetaMask

**Best for:** Users who&apos;ve been rugged before and want to see exactly what every transaction does.

### 5. Backpack - best for Solana power users

**Chains:** Solana, Ethereum  
**Type:** Browser extension + Mobile  
**Best for:** Traders, xNFT explorers

Built by the team behind Mad Lads, Backpack is a next-gen wallet with xNFT support - apps that live inside your wallet. It&apos;s sleek, powerful, and appeals to crypto-native users.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ xNFT ecosystem
- ✅ Beautiful design
- ✅ Built-in trading features
- ✅ Multi-chain growing

**Drawbacks:**
- xNFT ecosystem still developing
- More complex than basic wallets

**Best for:** Power users who want cutting-edge features.

---

### 6. Trust Wallet - best mobile-first wallet

**Chains:** 100+ chains (EVM, Solana, Cosmos, etc.)  
**Type:** Mobile-first + Browser  
**Best for:** Mobile users, beginners

Trust Wallet (owned by Binance) is one of the most downloaded crypto wallets globally. It supports virtually every chain and has a simple mobile interface.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ Massive chain support
- ✅ Simple for beginners
- ✅ Built-in staking
- ✅ DApp browser

**Drawbacks:**
- Binance ownership concerns some users
- Desktop experience weaker
- Can feel bloated

**Best for:** Mobile users who want one wallet for everything.

---

### 7. Coinbase Wallet - best for beginners

**Chains:** Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, 100+ chains  
**Type:** Mobile + Browser extension  
**Best for:** Crypto newcomers

Coinbase Wallet (separate from Coinbase exchange) is a solid self-custody option for people already familiar with Coinbase. It bridges the gap between CEX and DeFi.

**Why we like it:**
- ✅ Familiar brand
- ✅ Easy onboarding
- ✅ Multi-chain support
- ✅ Good integration with Coinbase exchange

**Drawbacks:**
- Less feature-rich than DeFi-native wallets
- Not the choice for power users

**Best for:** Coinbase users stepping into self-custody for the first time.

## Comparison

| Wallet | Best For | Chains | Key Feature |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Hubra** | All-in-one DeFi | Solana | Gasless + staking + explorer |
| **Phantom** | Solana users | Multi | Best Solana UX |
| **MetaMask** | EVM users | EVM only | Universal dApp support |
| **Rabby** | Security | EVM only | Transaction simulation |
| **Backpack** | Power users | Solana, ETH | xNFT apps |
| **Trust Wallet** | Mobile | 100+ chains | Chain variety |
| **Coinbase Wallet** | Beginners | Multi | Familiar brand |

## How to choose

**If you use Solana:** Hubra or Phantom  
**If you use Ethereum/EVM:** MetaMask or Rabby  
**If you want everything:** Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet  
**If you want all-in-one DeFi:** Hubra

Most serious DeFi users have 2-3 wallets for different chains and purposes. That&apos;s okay - just protect your seed phrases.

---

## Security tips

1. **Never share your seed phrase** - No legitimate service will ask for it
2. **Use a hardware wallet** for large holdings
3. **Verify URLs** before connecting - phishing is rampant
4. **Revoke unused approvals** regularly
5. **Start small** when trying new dApps

---

## Conclusion

The best DeFi wallet depends on what you&apos;re doing and which chains you use.

For **Solana users** who want simplicity + power, **Hubra** offers the most complete experience - portfolio tracking, swaps, staking, and protocol exploration in one app.

For **EVM users**, **MetaMask** remains the standard, though **Rabby** is worth trying for better security visibility.

Whatever you choose, the most important thing is: **you control your keys.** That&apos;s what DeFi is all about.
