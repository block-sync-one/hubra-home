# Solana's Breakout Year and the UX Challenge Ahead

Solana's ecosystem in 2025 has become one of the fastest-growing forces in blockchain. With a **9x increase in TVL**, millions of daily users, and major institutions issuing real-world assets on-chain, Solana is entering a new phase of maturity.
But despite this explosive growth, the ecosystem still faces one major barrier to mainstream adoption: **user experience**.

As more users explore DeFi, the gap between Solana's technical performance and the simplicity people expect becomes increasingly clear. This gap is most visible among retail users and active traders who want on-chain yields without navigating fragmented DeFi tooling.
Enter Hubra, an early-stage Solana-native product focused on simplifying on-chain earning and access.


## Solana Ecosystem in 2025: Growth, TVL, and On-Chain Activity

Solana has shifted from a niche experiment to one of the strongest ecosystems in Web3. Key indicators highlight its momentum:

- **High on-chain activity:** Millions of daily active addresses and tens of millions of transactions show robust engagement, growing **3x YoY** ([source: DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/solana?tvl=false&activeAddresses=true&currency=USD&groupBy=monthly)).

- **Dominance in DeFi:** Including Stablecoins, DEX volume, and liquid staking ([source: DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/solana)).

- **Major Institutional adoption:** We are seeing some of the most established institutions such as JPMorgan, R3 and Keel investing considerable amounts into RWA on Solana, including the latest Galaxy Digital bond issuance. Their 'real-money test case' sets the tone for where institutions are heading in 2026, with Solana ([source: Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/jpmorgan-arranges-galaxy-bond-issuance-on-solana-blockchain?taid=693af1c3812a0300017aa603&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_content=business&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)).

The chart above shows Solana's TVL growth and active addresses chart. The numbers tell a clear story: Solana has the infrastructure, the liquidity, and the institutional backing. What it needs now is the user experience layer that makes all of this accessible.


## The UX Challenges Holding Solana Back: The Tech Is Ready But User Experience Isn't Yet

Despite impressive on-chain traffic and TVL, retail users still face challenges. The expectations for simplicity, speed, and a seamless user experience, often associated with centralised platforms, create fractures. Many users still struggle with:

- **Complicated User Flows**: Users are accustomed to streamlined processes (KYC/CEX), making DeFi seem daunting. The learning curve isn't just about understanding blockchain—it's about navigating interfaces that weren't designed with mainstream users in mind.
- **Fragmented Interfaces**: Yield and trading opportunities are scattered across multiple apps, with most platforms offering complex, single-use tools rather than an end-to-end experience. This fragmentation hinders mainstream adoption.
- **Trust Issues**: Fear around non-custodial vs. custodial accounts, risks associated with slashing, and counterparty vulnerabilities hinder onboarding. Users want the security of self-custody without the complexity that typically comes with it.

*Simply put without a good user experience, speed and scale won't attract users.*


## How Hubra Improves Solana's User Experience?

By understanding both user needs and the ecosystem's push toward mainstream adoption, Hubra blends the simplicity of CEX with the transparency of DeFi, creating a unified 'command center' for users. Key features include:

- **CEX-like Simplicity**: A unified interface simplifies processes such as gasless swaps and easy onboarding while maintaining user control over keys. Users get the familiar experience they expect from traditional finance, but with the benefits of on-chain transparency and self-custody.

- **Aggregated Yield Opportunities**: By collating yield prospects from various Solana protocols, Hubra eliminates friction associated with yield discovery. Instead of visiting multiple platforms, users can see and access the best opportunities from a single interface.

These functionalities address critical friction points evident in the current DeFi landscape ([source: Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/09/23/wall-street-wants-in-on-defi-here-s-how-to-make-it-happen)). Hubra on the Solana Seeker dApp store is already working to resolve these friction points ([source: Hubra Blog - solana seeker](/blog/solana-seeker)).


## Why This Matters For The Broader Solana Ecosystem?

Solana's inherent advantages are speed, low cost, and composability. But there is a glass ceiling that needs to be broken in order to continue the growth…and that is **adoption**. The problem is the lack of simplicity. The solution is what we are focusing on:

- **Lowering Onboarding Friction**: More users can benefit from a CEX-like experience but on-chain effortlessly. When the barrier to entry is low, more people can participate in the ecosystem's growth.

- **Increasing Composability Capture**: By enabling access to multiple protocols from a single interface, user attention consolidates, improving liquidity. This benefits the entire ecosystem as more capital flows through more protocols.

- **Driving Measurable On-Chain Activity**: Streamlined processes encourage frequent interactions, enhancing fee capture across various applications. When users can easily move between opportunities, they're more likely to engage with the ecosystem regularly.

In essence, Hubra acts as the crucial UX layer that translates backend advancements into tangible consumer behaviour, bridging the gap between functionality and user experience.

## Conclusion: Two Halves Of The Same Coin

Solana has the supply side: throughput, liquidity and products. What is lacking to complete mainstream adoption is **demand-side usability**.
In other words, products that let normal users and traders act on opportunities without friction. That is what Hubra is built for; a conversion layer that keeps the chain's DeFi benefits while offering the simple, familiar experiences users expect in TradFi.

Solana will continue to ship infrastructure and apps and Hubra will continue lowering the barrier for real people to use them. We see the ecosystem's next chapter not about transactions per second but about **millions of users confidently using and earning on-chain every day**.
