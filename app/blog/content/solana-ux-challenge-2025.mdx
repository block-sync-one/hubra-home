## Solana&apos;s big year - and the UX problem holding it back

Solana had a breakout 2025. TVL jumped 9x. Millions of users showed up. Big institutions started issuing real-world assets on-chain. The ecosystem matured fast.

But there&apos;s still one thing blocking mainstream adoption: user experience.

As more people try DeFi, the gap between Solana&apos;s technical performance and the simplicity users expect becomes obvious. This gap hits hardest with retail users and active traders who want on-chain yields without wading through fragmented tools.

That&apos;s where Hubra comes in - an early-stage Solana product focused on making on-chain earning actually simple.

## Solana in 2025: the numbers

Solana went from niche experiment to one of the strongest ecosystems in Web3. The data tells the story:

**High on-chain activity:** Millions of daily active addresses. Tens of millions of transactions. Engagement grew 3x year-over-year ([DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/solana?tvl=false&activeAddresses=true&currency=USD&groupBy=monthly)).

**DeFi dominance:** Leading in stablecoins, DEX volume, and liquid staking ([DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/solana)).

**Institutional adoption:** JPMorgan, R3, and Keel are investing heavily in RWA on Solana. Galaxy Digital&apos;s recent bond issuance on Solana sets the tone for where institutions are heading in 2026 ([Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/jpmorgan-arranges-galaxy-bond-issuance-on-solana-blockchain)).

The infrastructure is there. The liquidity is there. The backing is there. What&apos;s missing is the UX layer that makes it all accessible.

## The UX problems holding Solana back

Despite impressive traffic and TVL, regular users still struggle. The simplicity they expect from centralized platforms? Not there yet.

**Complicated flows:** Users are used to streamlined CEX processes. DeFi feels daunting. The learning curve isn&apos;t just about understanding blockchain - it&apos;s about navigating interfaces that weren&apos;t built for normal people.

**Fragmented tools:** Yield opportunities are scattered across apps. Most platforms offer complex, single-use tools instead of an end-to-end experience. This fragmentation kills adoption.

**Trust issues:** Fear around non-custodial vs custodial, slashing risks, counterparty exposure - all of it slows onboarding. People want self-custody security without self-custody complexity.

Bottom line: without good UX, speed and scale won&apos;t attract users.

## How Hubra fixes Solana&apos;s UX problem

Hubra blends CEX simplicity with DeFi transparency. Think of it as a unified command center for on-chain users.

**CEX-like simplicity:** One interface for gasless swaps and easy onboarding - while users keep control of their keys. The familiar experience people expect from traditional finance, but with on-chain transparency and self-custody.

**Aggregated yield:** Instead of visiting multiple platforms, users see and access the best opportunities from one place. No more hunting across ten different sites.

These features address the friction points that matter ([Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/09/23/wall-street-wants-in-on-defi-here-s-how-to-make-it-happen)). Hubra on the Solana Seeker dApp store is already working to solve them ([Hubra Blog](/blog/solana-seeker)).

## Why this matters for Solana

Solana&apos;s advantages are speed, low cost, and composability. But there&apos;s a glass ceiling: adoption. The problem is lack of simplicity. Here&apos;s what good UX unlocks:

**Lower onboarding friction:** More users benefit from CEX-like experience but on-chain. When the barrier is low, more people join.

**Better composability capture:** Access to multiple protocols from one interface consolidates user attention and improves liquidity. The whole ecosystem benefits.

**More on-chain activity:** Streamlined processes encourage frequent interactions. When users can easily move between opportunities, they engage regularly.

Hubra acts as the UX layer that translates backend advances into actual user behavior. It bridges functionality and experience.

## The bottom line

Solana has the supply side: throughput, liquidity, products.

What&apos;s missing for mainstream adoption is demand-side usability. Products that let normal users and traders act on opportunities without friction.

That&apos;s what Hubra is built for - a conversion layer that keeps DeFi benefits while offering the simple, familiar experience users expect from traditional finance.

Solana will keep shipping infrastructure and apps. Hubra will keep lowering the barrier for real people to use them.

The ecosystem&apos;s next chapter isn&apos;t about transactions per second. It&apos;s about millions of users confidently using and earning on-chain every day.
