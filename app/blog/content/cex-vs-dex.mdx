The crypto world is split into two camps: centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Both let you trade crypto, but they work completely differently.

**Which one should you use?** It depends on what matters most to you — convenience, control, security, or features. Let&apos;s break it down.

---

## What is a CEX (Centralized Exchange)?

A **centralized exchange** is a company that operates a trading platform. Think Binance, Coinbase, Kraken. You create an account, deposit funds, and the exchange holds your crypto in their wallets.

**How it works:**
1. You sign up (KYC usually required)
2. You deposit fiat or crypto
3. The exchange holds your funds
4. You trade on their order books
5. You withdraw when ready

**Examples:** Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit

---

## What is a DEX (Decentralized Exchange)?

A **decentralized exchange** is a set of smart contracts that let you trade directly from your wallet. No company holds your funds. No account needed.

**How it works:**
1. Connect your wallet
2. Approve the token you want to trade
3. Swap happens on-chain via smart contracts
4. Tokens go directly to your wallet

**Examples:** Uniswap (Ethereum), Jupiter (Solana), Raydium (Solana)

## CEX vs DEX: The Full Comparison

| Factor | CEX | DEX |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Custody** | Exchange holds your funds | You hold your funds |
| **KYC Required** | Yes (usually) | No |
| **Account needed** | Yes | No — just a wallet |
| **Fiat on-ramp** | Yes | Limited |
| **Trading speed** | Very fast | Fast (varies by chain) |
| **Fees** | Low-medium | Low (+ gas fees) |
| **Token selection** | Curated | Anything on-chain |
| **Security risk** | Exchange hacks | Smart contract bugs |
| **Privacy** | Low | High |
| **Recovery if hacked** | Sometimes | No |

## The Case for CEX

### ✅ Pros

**Familiar UX**
CEXs work like traditional brokerages. Clean interfaces, customer support, mobile apps. If you&apos;re coming from stocks, it feels natural.

**Fiat on/off ramps**
Want to buy crypto with your credit card or bank transfer? CEXs make this easy. Most DEXs don&apos;t support fiat directly.

**High liquidity**
Major CEXs have deep order books. Large trades execute with minimal slippage.

**Customer support**
Locked out of your account? Lost your 2FA? CEXs have support teams. DEXs don&apos;t.

### ❌ Cons

**Not your keys, not your coins**
When you deposit to a CEX, you&apos;re trusting them with your money. Exchanges can freeze accounts, get hacked, or go bankrupt (see: FTX, Mt. Gox, Celsius).

**KYC and surveillance**
You&apos;ll need to provide ID, address, sometimes even proof of funds. Your trading history is tied to your identity.

**Limited token access**
CEXs only list tokens they approve. New projects, memecoins, and small-cap gems often aren&apos;t available.

---

## The Case for DEX

### ✅ Pros

**Full custody**
Your crypto never leaves your wallet until you swap. No one can freeze your funds or block your trades.

**Privacy**
No KYC. No account. Just connect and trade. Your wallet address is pseudonymous.

**Any token, instantly**
If a token exists on-chain, you can trade it on a DEX. No waiting for listings.

**Permissionless**
DEXs can&apos;t discriminate. Anyone with a wallet can trade, anywhere in the world.

### ❌ Cons

**Steeper learning curve**
Managing wallets, approving transactions, understanding gas — it&apos;s more complex than clicking &quot;Buy&quot; on Coinbase.

**Smart contract risk**
DEXs run on code. Bugs or exploits can drain funds, and there&apos;s no customer support to call.

**No fiat (usually)**
You&apos;ll need crypto to start. Getting fiat into a DEX typically requires a CEX first, or an on-ramp service.

**Scam tokens**
Anyone can create a token. Without CEX curation, you might trade a worthless or malicious token.

## Security: The Real Difference

This is where it gets serious.

**CEX risks:**
- Exchange hacks (billions lost over the years)
- Insider theft
- Bankruptcy (FTX collapsed with user funds)
- Account freezes (your access can be revoked)

**DEX risks:**
- Smart contract exploits
- Phishing (malicious approval requests)
- User error (sending to wrong address)

**The key insight:** With a CEX, you trust a company. With a DEX, you trust code (and yourself).

Neither is &quot;safer&quot; — they have different risk profiles. But only with a DEX do you have **sovereignty** over your assets.

## When to Use a CEX

- You&apos;re new to crypto and want an easy start
- You need to buy/sell with fiat
- You trade large volumes and need deep liquidity
- You&apos;re comfortable trusting a regulated company

---

## When to Use a DEX

- You want full control of your crypto
- You value privacy
- You want access to new/unlisted tokens
- You&apos;re in a region with limited CEX access
- You don&apos;t trust centralized entities

## CEX vs DEX: The Verdict

| If you want... | Choose... |
|----------------|-----------|

| Full custody | DEX |
| Customer support | CEX |
| Privacy | DEX |
| Any token access | DEX |
| Simple UX + self-custody | **Hubra** |
