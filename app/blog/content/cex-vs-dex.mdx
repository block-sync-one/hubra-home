The crypto world splits into two camps: centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). Both let you trade crypto, but they work completely differently.

Which one should you use? It depends on what matters most to you - convenience, control, security, or features.

---

## What is a CEX?

A centralized exchange is a company that runs a trading platform. Think Binance, Coinbase, Kraken. You create an account, deposit funds, and the exchange holds your crypto in their wallets.

How it works:

- You sign up (KYC usually required)
- You deposit fiat or crypto
- The exchange holds your funds
- You trade on their order books
- You withdraw when ready

Examples: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, Bybit

---

## What is a DEX?

A decentralized exchange is a set of smart contracts that let you trade directly from your wallet. No company holds your funds. No account needed.

How it works:

- Connect your wallet
- Approve the token you want to trade
- Swap happens on-chain via smart contracts
- Tokens go directly to your wallet

Examples: Uniswap (Ethereum), Jupiter (Solana), Raydium (Solana)

## CEX vs DEX comparison

| Factor | CEX | DEX |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Custody | Exchange holds your funds | You hold your funds |
| KYC Required | Yes (usually) | No |
| Account needed | Yes | No - just a wallet |
| Fiat on-ramp | Yes | Limited |
| Trading speed | Very fast | Fast (varies by chain) |
| Fees | Low-medium | Low (+ gas fees) |
| Token selection | Curated | Anything on-chain |
| Security risk | Exchange hacks | Smart contract bugs |
| Privacy | Low | High |
| Recovery if hacked | Sometimes | No |

## Why use a CEX

### Pros

**Familiar UX** - CEXs work like traditional brokerages. Clean interfaces, customer support, mobile apps. If you&apos;re coming from stocks, it feels natural.

**Fiat on/off ramps** - Want to buy crypto with your credit card or bank transfer? CEXs make this easy. Most DEXs don&apos;t support fiat directly.

**High liquidity** - Major CEXs have deep order books. Large trades execute with minimal slippage.

**Customer support** - Locked out of your account? Lost your 2FA? CEXs have support teams. DEXs don&apos;t.

### Cons

**Not your keys, not your coins** - When you deposit to a CEX, you&apos;re trusting them with your money. Exchanges can freeze accounts, get hacked, or go bankrupt (see: FTX, Mt. Gox, Celsius).

**KYC and surveillance** - You&apos;ll need to provide ID, address, sometimes proof of funds. Your trading history is tied to your identity.

**Limited token access** - CEXs only list tokens they approve. New projects, memecoins, and small-cap gems often aren&apos;t available.

---

## Why use a DEX

### Pros

**Full custody** - Your crypto never leaves your wallet until you swap. No one can freeze your funds or block your trades.

**Privacy** - No KYC. No account. Just connect and trade. Your wallet address is pseudonymous.

**Any token, instantly** - If a token exists on-chain, you can trade it on a DEX. No waiting for listings.

**Permissionless** - DEXs can&apos;t discriminate. Anyone with a wallet can trade, anywhere in the world.

### Cons

**Steeper learning curve** - Managing wallets, approving transactions, understanding gas - it&apos;s more complex than clicking &quot;Buy&quot; on Coinbase.

**Smart contract risk** - DEXs run on code. Bugs or exploits can drain funds, and there&apos;s no customer support to call.

**No fiat (usually)** - You&apos;ll need crypto to start. Getting fiat into a DEX typically requires a CEX first, or an on-ramp service.

**Scam tokens** - Anyone can create a token. Without CEX curation, you might trade a worthless or malicious token.

## Security

CEX risks:

- Exchange hacks (billions lost over the years)
- Insider theft
- Bankruptcy (FTX collapsed with user funds)
- Account freezes (your access can be revoked)

DEX risks:

- Smart contract exploits
- Phishing (malicious approval requests)
- User error (sending to wrong address)

With a CEX, you trust a company. With a DEX, you trust code and yourself.

Neither is &quot;safer&quot; - they have different risk profiles. But only with a DEX do you have sovereignty over your assets.

---

## When to use a CEX

- You&apos;re new to crypto and want an easy start
- You need to buy/sell with fiat
- You trade large volumes and need deep liquidity
- You&apos;re comfortable trusting a regulated company

---

## When to use a DEX

- You want full control of your crypto
- You value privacy
- You want access to new/unlisted tokens
- You&apos;re in a region with limited CEX access
- You don&apos;t trust centralized entities

---

---

## The verdict

| If you want... | Choose... |
|----------------|-----------|
| Easy fiat access | CEX |
| Full custody | DEX |
| Customer support | CEX |
| Privacy | DEX |
| Any token access | DEX |
| Simple UX + self-custody | Hubra |

For most users in 2026, the answer isn&apos;t CEX or DEX - it&apos;s both, depending on the situation. Use a CEX for fiat. Use a DEX (or Hubra) for everything else.

---

## Bottom line

CEXs are convenient but require trust. DEXs give you control but demand responsibility.

The crypto space is moving toward self-custody. With platforms like Hubra making DEX trading as simple as Binance, there&apos;s less reason to leave funds on an exchange.

Your keys. Your coins. Your choice.
