## Security Best Practices

Regardless of which wallet you choose, follow these security practices:

### 1. Secure Your Seed Phrase

- Write it down on paper (not digital)
- Store in multiple secure locations
- Never share with anyone
- Never enter it on a website

### 2. Use Hardware Wallets for Large Holdings

For significant amounts, pair your software wallet with a hardware wallet like Ledger. This adds a physical security layer that prevents remote attacks.

### 3. Verify Transactions

Always review what you're signing:
- Check the recipient address
- Verify the amounts
- Look for suspicious permissions
- Use transaction simulation when available

### 4. Protect Against Phishing

- Bookmark official dApp URLs
- Never click links from unsolicited messages
- Verify you're on the real site before connecting
- Be suspicious of "free" airdrops requiring wallet connections

### 5. Use Separate Wallets

Consider using:
- One wallet for high-value holdings
- One wallet for daily DeFi activity
- Burner wallets for risky interactions

### If you're primarily on Solana...

**Phantom** is the safe choice for most users. It's polished, widely supported, and just works. For staking focus, consider **Solflare**. For advanced features and open source values, try **Backpack**.
